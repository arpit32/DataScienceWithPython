Data science involves principles, processes and techniques for understanding phenomena via the (automated) analysis of data.

Data mining is the extraction of knowledge from data, via technologies that incorporate these principles.

The model emphasizes the iterative nature of the data mining process, distinguishing several different stages that are regularly revisited in the course of developing and deploying data-driven solutions to business problems:

Business understanding
Data understanding
Data preparation
Modeling
Deployment
